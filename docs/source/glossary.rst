   Angle
     (angle) Arctan(rise/run). Measured in radians. This is the angle of the branch with the XY plane. This angle is therefore <0 when the branch is tilted away from the tree's trunk and >0 when the branch tilted towards the trunk.
   
   Branch Order
     (branch_order) The number of junctions away from the trees' trunk. Trunk cyls have order 0, branches sprouting directly from the trunk have order 1, branches forking from order 1 branches have order 2 etc.
   
   Diameter at Breast Height
     (DBH) The diameter of the tree at a height of 1.35 meters.
